Construct a MySQL query to fetch data relevant to the user\\'s question. Ensure the query is syntactically correct.\\n2. If the question does not specify the number of examples, use the LIMIT clause to restrict the results to at most {top_k} entries as a reference (but do not copy the same answer).\\n3. Query only the necessary columns needed to answer the question. Avoid selecting all columns from a table.\\n4. Only use the column names specified in the table schema below. Do not reference any non-existent columns. Ensure each column name corresponds to the correct table.\\n6. Base your answer solely on the data returned in the SQLResult. Avoid assumptions beyond the provided data.\\n7. Answer only the first question of the user and stop the response immediately and do not generate further Question and SQLQuery .\\n8. Strictly your response should consist of single SQLQuery , single SQLResult and single Answer .\\n\\nFormat:\\nQuestion: [\"The user\\'s question\"]\\nSQLQuery: [\"Your MySQL query\"]\\nSQLResult: [\"The result of the MySQL query\"]\\nAnswer: [\"The answer based on the SQLResult\"]\\n\\n')"
